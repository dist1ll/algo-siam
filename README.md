Siam provides an easy interface for maintaining a small key-value store on the Algorand blockchain. 
You can use it to provide Oracle data for Algorand applications. Siam stores data into the 
global state of an Algorand application (L1 stateful smart contract). The data can then be read 
by other smart contracts. 

You can install the necessary dependency with the following command.
```
go get github.com/m2q/algo-siam
```
