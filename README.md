Siam is a library that allows you to use an Algorand application as a small key-value store.
It provides an easy interface for maintaining and updating data to the on-chain app. 
You can use it to provide Oracle data for Algorand applications. Siam stores data into the 
global state of the application, which can then be read by other parties in the Algorand chain.

You can install the necessary dependency with the following command.
```
go get github.com/m2q/algo-siam
```
